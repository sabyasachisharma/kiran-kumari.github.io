I am a **Computational Scientist at Max Planck Institute of Infectious Diseases**, with a strong academic and research background in **chemical engineering**, **computational biology**, **soft-matter physics**, and **biophysics**. My work focuses on **data-driven integrative modeling**, combining experimental datasets with biophysical simulations to investigate complex biological systems in healthy and diseased states.

### Research Training and Interests

My expertise spans three broad areas:
1. **Epigenetics and Chromatin Organization**: Studying the 3D structure of chromatin in cancer cells, focusing on how DNA folding and epigenetics influence gene transcription and cell proliferation. This includes investigating multi-way enhancer-promoter interactions in transcription regulation.
2. **Data-Driven Modeling**: Utilizing computational techniques to integrate experimental data, analyze Hi-C and ChIP-Seq datasets, and develop biophysical models.
3. **Self-Assembly in Soft Matter Systems**: Conducting theoretical and computational studies of soft-matter systems, including chromatin dynamics and polymer simulations.

I have developed and used various computational and statistical tools, such as:
- **Brownian Dynamics Simulations**: To model chromatin polymer behavior.
- **Inverse Brownian Dynamics**: To extract information from chromosome conformation capture experiments.
- **Monte Carlo and Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations**: For soft-matter system studies.
